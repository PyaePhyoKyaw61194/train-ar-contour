## About
  The app will scan the images (up to 4) and adding the images to the sides of the train 3D model. 
  
  I use iOS new Contour detection and Augumented Reality related API.
  
## How to use
  * Open the app
  * Point to the image you want to detect.
  * The contoured lines will appear. Press **Scan** when you get the shape you want.
  * Since this is for testing purposes, Complex shapes may not be detected properly.
  * Scan 4 images and press AR view ( AR view button only works if there are 4 detected shapes)
  * Move your phone around a bit to display the Train model with the detected shapes on the sides.
